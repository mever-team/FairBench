# Report keys

Here is a list of all keys that you may try to extract from reports,
for example with the dot notation like `report.acc` to obtain
all accuracy computations or `report.min.roc` to obtain all receiver operating
characteristic curves under minimum reductions. Not all keys are present in all reports.

!!! info
    This is a reminder that
    viewing reports based on keys comes in addition to user-defined sensitive attribute dimension names and 
    `Progress` instance names. For example, use `report["male"]` or `report.male` to
    focus on the namesake sensitive attribute dimension - the dict notation is a supplement
    in case the names have spaces or special characters.

## Quantities
