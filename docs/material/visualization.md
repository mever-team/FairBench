# Visualization

Reports accept visualization environments as arguments to their `show` method.
These environments can be either static or interactive, where the last
category requires FairBench to be installed with the `interactive` extra
dependencies like below. You can always install specific libraries by looking
at error messages to avoid the full bundle.

```bash
pip install --upgrade fairbench[interactive]
```

## Console

The default visualization environment prints all report
details in the console (it also uses ansi color codes
that do not appear in this page). This environment can be
explicitly selected by passing its class as an argument
to the `show` method, in which case it is instantiated
with its default values.

```python
report.show(env=fb.export.Console)
```

The above makes use of the [ansiplot](https://github.com/maniospas/ansiplot)
library to have some nice plots. You can switch
to a less verbose style by manually instantiating
the environment instead of passing its class to
be created with the default arguments:

```python
report.show(env=fb.export.Console(ansiplot=False))
```

## ConsoleTable

A more concise visualization strategy is to create
tables in the console, like below. This also admits
a `sideways` argument with default value True
that determines whether to attempt to show
multiple tables side-by-side if necessary.
It also accepts a `legend` argument with default False
about showing additional textual descriptions,
similarly to the console report.

```python
report.show(fb.export.ConsoleTable)
```

```

```

!!! tip
    The default options of ConsoleTable provides the most concise representation of results.
    However, you might need refreshers about each entry, for example by adding a legend
    or simply running `report.help()` first.

## Html

This is an equivalent to the Console environment that converts
presented text and quantities to a static HTML page. That page 
displays evaluation cards one under the other, as demonstrated
[here](../documentation/example_html.html) for the fairness 
model card filtering found in the [quickstart](../quickstart.md).

If you have a wide screen, it may be more convenient to display 
the individual cards side-by-side by setting `horizontal=False` 
in the environment's constructor. An example is shown below.
Get the generated HTML in text form without opening any browser
window, for example to show later, by passing `view=False` 
to the constructor. Here is an example of what this looks like 
in code.

```python
report = ... # compute fairness report
html_text = report.show(fb.export.Html(horizontal=False, view=False)) 
```

![html_horizontal.png](html_horizontal.png)


## HtmlTable

This is an equivalent to the ConsoleTable environment that
again converts the generated tables to a static HTML page.
Below is an example outcome of `report.show(fb.export.HtmlTable)`.

![html_table.png](html_table.png)

## PlotlyHeatMap

!!! warning
    Plotly is installed as part of the interactive extras.

This is similar to the HtmlTable environment, with the 
difference that Plotly is used for heatmap plotting of
the values.


## ToJson

When provided as an environment to the `show` method, it does
not create any visual output but instead returns a string
that is a json damp of the report values. This can be used
to reconstruct the report like so:

```python
import fairbench as fb
import json

# serialize a report
json_dump = report.show(env=fb.export.ToJson)
# deserialize
dicts_and_lists = json.loads(json_dump)
reconstructed = fb.core.Value.from_dict(dicts_and_lists)
```
