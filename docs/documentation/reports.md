# Reports

Reports perform multi-faceted analyses of system outcomes
(e.g., predictions, recommendations, regression scores)
to quantify biases and fairness. Computations are retained
in the final report. Mainly, report outcomes can be filtered
to augment their values with various strategies,
and shown using various visualization environments.
They can also be serialized and deserialized.

## Arguments

You can generate reports by providing some
of the optional arguments below to some
of the report generation methods.
Base performance measures to compute
are automatically selected based on available information.

Sensitive attributes contain multiple
[dimensions](dimensions)
that treat multi-value attributes or multiple
sensitive attribute values interchangeably.

| Argument    | Role                | Values                                                                |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| predictions | system output       | binary array                                                          |
| scores      | system output       | array with elements in [0,1]                                          |
| targets     | prediction target   | array with elements in [0,1]                                          | 
| order       | order target        | array whose element order should be replicated (e.g., may have ranks) |      
| labels      | prediction target   | binary array                                                          | 
| sensitive   | sensitive attribute | fork of arrays with elements in [0,1] (either binary or fuzzy)        |

!!! info
    In multiclass settings, all keyword
    arguments other than the sensitive attribute
    must be dimensions corresponding to the classes.

## Report types

Out-of-the box, you can use one of the following
report generation methods, obtained from FairBench's 
`reports`module:

| Report   | Description                                                                    |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| pairwise | Compares groups pairwise when needed.                                          |
| vsall    | Adds the whole population as an 'all' group and compares other groups to this. |
| report   | Creates a report with manually declared metrics and reduction strategies.      |


## Usage

As an example, create a simple report
based on binary predictions, binary
ideal predictions and multiclass
sensitive attribute `sensitive`. The
sensitive attribute is declared to be a fork with two branches
*men,women*, each of which is a binary
feature value. Finally, use the `show` method
to visualize the report using the console,
which is the default visualization engine.

```python
import fairbench as fb

sensitive = fb.Dimensions(men=[1, 1, 0, 0, 0], women=[0, 0, 1, 1, 1])
report = fb.reports.pairwise(
    predictions=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0], 
    labels=[1, 0, 0, 1, 0], 
    sensitive=sensitive
)
report.show()
```

Below is the visualization's outcome. Notice that descriptions
are provided for non-terminal values.

## Visualization

The above example uses the `show` method to print to the console.
The same method can create various types of exports.
For example, view the report's outcome in the browser by using a different visualization
argument, such as with `report.show(env=fb.export.Html)`. Find a 
full list of visualization environments [here](../material/visualization.md).

The same method also admits a `depth` argument that determines
the level of detail, where the default is zero. At least the top
set of numeric values will be shown regardless of the detail level.
All visualization environments can work with any set depth, though
beware that large depths may create imprtactically many details;
you might want to specialize like below.
