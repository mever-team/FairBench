# Benchmarks

Here we show how to run and compare algorithms. To give a taste of
the library's ability to accommodate various kinds of data without
changing anything, we assess computer vision systems.

Before starting, install FairBench with any needed extra dependencies (extras).
These install libraries required by models of the corresponding data types. 
Tabular data benchmarks do not need any extras. To install with all extras run:

```shell
pip install --upgrade fairbench[graph,llm,vision]
```

!!! warning
    Benchmarks using extras may download a lot of data (partially due to the
    size of libraries like *torch*) and need sufficient resources to run. These
    constraints are standard for the respective domains and are needed to run
    experiments whose outcomes FairBench analyses.

## 1. Setup experiments

There is little distinction between running different algorithms 
or different data with the workflow shown next; each algorithm-data 
pair is distinct. This simplification is not mandatory, but simpler to explore
given that we aim to explore multiple types of bias assessment too.
Automatically download and run datasets and models with
FairBench, which is why we installed the extras installed above.
Alternatively, create predictions with your own workflow
and skip this step.

Datasets are set up as callable methods under `bench` 
modules; they run provided algorithms in
a standardized way. 
Datasets can also run with 
your own models. In domains where large
models are the norm, like Vision and LLMs, provided algorithms/models are assumed to be already trained.

Below is an example that runs two classifiers on the `utkface`
vision dataset. You can aso set up experiments where you pass a torch
model as a classifier instead of a string name.

```python
import fairbench as fb

experiments = {
    "flac utkface": lambda: fb.bench.vision.utkface(classifier="flac"),
    "badd utkface": lambda: fb.bench.vision.utkface(classifier="badd")
}
```

## 2. Gather reports

!!! info
    Get familiar with generating standalone fairness reports in the [quickstart](reports). 

FairBench offers the `Progress` class to gather several fairness reports
by registering them sequentially. It can yield an amalgamation at any point.
The same class can also track the evolution of datasets and algorithms over time.
Here is how to add report/value instances to progress and build
a report that contains all of them:

```python
settings = fb.Progress("settings")
for name, experiment in experiments.items():
    y, yhat, sensitive = experiment()
    sensitive = fb.Dimensions(fb.categories @ sensitive)
    report = fb.reports.pairwise(predictions=yhat, labels=y, sensitive=sensitive)
    settings.instance(name, report)
comparison = settings.build()

comparison.show(fb.export.ConsoleTable)
```

```

Serialize and serialize reports like below, for
example to cache results and facilitate future exploration.
Use the same mechanism to keep track of data across multiple runs
in case of time evolving reports.

```python
import os.path
import json

if not os.path.exists("cache.json"):
    ... # the rest of the code here
    comparison = settings.build()
    with open("cache.json", "w") as file:
        file.write(json.dumps(comparison.to_dict()))
else:
    with open("cache.json", "r") as file:
        comparison = fb.core.Value.from_dict(json.loads(file.read()))
```

## 3. Compare and explore

Alter how reports are organized
at the top level using `.explain`. This is helpful for side-by-side comparison,
for example with the following recipe. The console table visualization
environment below requests usage `sideways=False` instead its default value once
it realizes there are conflicting row names, like *min acc*  vs *maxerror acc*. 
All visualizations generalize to any number of comparisons.

```python
comparison.explain.show(env=fb.export.ConsoleTable(sideways=False)) 
```

*Output omitted for brevity. It is similar to the last one in this page.*

Explore reports of any complexity by focusing on contributing
computations of interest. Do this programmatically with the dot notation or, 
when the former would not be valid Python, by looking up the computation as in
a dictionary with its string name.
Exploration is made easier with interactive visualization environments [here](documentation/interactive.md).
Or you can show all specification with the report's `.help()` method, which can be called
at any point of specialization.

Below is an exploration example. In this, we focus on both accuracy and the maximum difference reduction 
to keep the outcome simple.

```python
comparison.acc.explain["maxdiff explain mean"].show(env=fb.export.Console)
```

```text
##### maxdiff #####
|This reduction is the maximum difference.
|Computations cover several cases.

```

## 4. Simplify the comparison 

Apply filters to retain only specific types of evaluation,
such as computations that show only bias
or bias/fairness values violating certain thresholds.

One of the available filters, which is presented
below, hides deviations from ideal values
lesser than `0.1` (also hides values whose
ideal targets cannot be determined). Observe
how the report is simplified into its most
problematic elements. If everything was rejected,
it would not indicate fairness -which is a subjective belief-
but rather that stricter thresholds should be explored.

```python
filter = fb.investigate.DeviationsOver(0.1)
env = fb.export.ConsoleTable(sideways=False) # not sideways because the environment complains about different rows
comparison.filter(filter).show(env=env)  
```

```text
settings flac utkface multidim
                                   maxerror       maxrel
tpr                                   0.141

tar                                                0.111

settings badd utkface multidim
                                   maxerror       maxrel
tnr                                   0.134             
pr                                                 0.181
tar                                                0.125
trr                                                0.150
```

## 5. Multiple runs

Use the same progress tracking mechanism to keep track
of multiple experiment repetitions, if you need to. 
Then, apply the 
library's reduction mechanisms -the same ones employed
within reports- as filters to aggregate information
across repetitions.

In the example below, the average across 5 experiment
repetitions is shown for all measures. This just a demonstration, 
as the test classifiers
have no randomization and produce the same results always.
All computational information is still being tracked, so you can
delve into details afterwards.

```python
settings = fb.Progress("settings")
for name, experiment in experiments.items():
    repetitions = fb.Progress("5 repetitions")
    for repetition in range(5):
        y, yhat, sensitive = experiment()
        sensitive = fb.Dimensions(fb.categories @ sensitive)
        report = fb.reports.pairwise(predictions=yhat, labels=y, sensitive=sensitive)
        repetitions.instance(f"repetition {repetition}", report)
        
    # get the average across repetitions
    mean_report = repetitions.build().filter(fb.reduction.mean)
    settings.instance(name, mean_report)

comparison = settings.build()
comparison.explain.show(env=fb.export.ConsoleTable(sideways=False)) 
```
