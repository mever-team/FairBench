# Introductory Notebooks

Here is some introductory material to see _fairbench_ in action. To run
the material yourself, install the library (and the _pygrank_ 
library for graph analysis) and install and run Jupyter notebook per:

```bash
pip install fairbench
pip install pygrank
pip install jupyter
jupyter-notebook
```

The following material are available:

1. **Introduction to FairBench** - Basic concepts on computation traceability and generating bias/fairness reports.
2. **Investigating an actual system** - Seeing in action how to explore results obtained for real systems.
3. **Mitigation in graphs** - A quick look at a couple of simple bias mitigation methods in graph node scoring.
